# Censor Swear Words plugin

This is a custom WordPress plugin I created. This plugin allows users to censor swear words on their site, and then choose how to censor each one individually. When the plugin is activated, a brand new option appears in the admin menu called "Censor Swear Words". They can then type in a comma-separated list of words they want to censor, then press "Save Changes". Then they can go to the settings submenu, and they will see a field for each of the words they typed in. They can then decide how exactly to censor each word. Then when they press "Save Changes", on the front end of the website, every instance of each of those words will be censored how the user typed in to censor each one. This can be useful if you want the first letter of each swear word to be visible but the rest to be stars or dashes, or the first and last letter of each word to be visible, or every letter except the vowels. Either way, it is up to the user of this plugin to customize how each individual swear word will be censored
